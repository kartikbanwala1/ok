# Yuo Selfbot (Source on [github](https://github.com/myrayuo))

Yuo Selfbot is the best discord selfbot 2021. What is this selfbot? Unlike a normal Self Bot, Yuo makes all it's request using your personal user token so that it can act as you. Therefore it will edit and post as you rather than a third-party bot making it look like you are doing things extremely fast like custom replies, animations, and more!

There are a ton of default commands, and easily loadable custom plugins. You are even able to run it in multiple workspaces at once READ MORE for info on the selfbot and commands.

Dm myrayuo#0001 or join https://discord.gg/2k3BpbMg5e for help also If you skid give cred lol.

# READ THIS:
  If u get errors in terminal thats alr nothing is wrong with the selfbot just ignore that part also if u don't wan't ur staus changing so u can use status commands. Go to line 676-709 and delete that whole part. And if some commands don't work that cuz of the projects cpu u can pay for more cpu or just leave it like it is. There's also a custom msg logger on line 485-489 along with a webhook sender on line 735-736. I also added mass dm to use it u will have to take out Yuo.py in .replit and replace it to say mass_dm.py and go to .env and make a new secret put target in key and put users token in value then run the project. You can do the same with nuke_bot.py but all u have to do is change Yuo.py to nuke_bot.py and put your bot token in. Btw when you add custom cmds in you have to add your commands in yuo.py from commands.csv thats all I have to say.


# .env Example:
  1. Copy Everything In EXAMPLE (MUST BE EXACTLY LIKE THAT OR IT WONT WORK) .env into your own .env (create a file called .env)
  2. Put this is the file (LOOK BELOW)
 ```
     token= NzcxODYzMzIyNzY0NTA5MjE2.YHv6Fg.c_8arU2nWc_zJgCOgjF6axmK3Hw // aint my token dumbfucks losers go kys fags
     password= // pass here (REQUIRED) 
     prefix= x // prefix
     nitro_sniper= true
     giveaway_sniper= true
     privnote_sniper= true
     slotbot_sniper= true
     rich_presence= true
     mention_logger= true
     block_ping= false
     donotdisturb = false

     bitly_key= true
